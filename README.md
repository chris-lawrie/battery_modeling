# battery_modelling

## Welcome
Hello there! This is the code for my battery model! 

The model allows the user to design a battery system that either stands alone, or be is connected to a wind or PV system. The model then figures out the most optimal charge/discharge behavior for this battery to maximise revenue.

The guts of the model are a just a linear program.


## Goals / Learnings for the project: 
I wanted a project to help teach people about linear programming, and in particular its uses in energy modeling. I also wanted an excuse to learn how to build a streamlit dashboard!
